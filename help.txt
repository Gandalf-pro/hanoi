Iterative solution

Animation of an iterative algorithm solving 6-disk problem
A simple solution for the toy puzzle is to alternate moves between the smallest piece 
and a non-smallest piece. When moving the smallest piece, always move it to the next position 
in the same direction (to the right if the starting number of pieces is even, 
to the left if the starting number of pieces is odd). If there is no tower position 
in the chosen direction, move the piece to the opposite end, but then continue to move 
in the correct direction. For example, if you started with three pieces, you would move the smallest piece
 to the opposite end, then continue in the left direction after that. When the turn is to move the 
 non-smallest piece, there is only one legal move. Doing this will complete the puzzle in the fewest moves.[5]

Simpler statement of iterative solution
For an even number of disks:

make the legal move between pegs A and B (in either direction),
make the legal move between pegs A and C (in either direction),
make the legal move between pegs B and C (in either direction),
repeat until complete.
For an odd number of disks:

make the legal move between pegs A and C (in either direction),
make the legal move between pegs A and B (in either direction),
make the legal move between pegs B and C (in either direction),
repeat until complete.
In each case, a total of 2n âˆ’ 1 moves are made.
